## Greetings fellow carbon based life forms, I'm Nixon 🧑🏽‍💻
I'm currently on a quest to learn the secrets of the digital universe, with a side mission of contributing to open source projects and creating personal projects that may or may not involve turning everyday objects into sentient beings. Also, I have an unexplainable fascination with rubber ducks. 🚀🤖🐤
